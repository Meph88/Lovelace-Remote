# Lovelace-Remote
Code to create a picture elements card in lovelace for Home Assistant.

This code coupled with these images will create an attractive remote in Home Assistant designed for controlling a home entertainment system.
It is sized to be pretty much full screen on most sized phone screens on most modern browsers but your experience may vary.

Optional card to add a quick way to press numbers.

Coming later:
- Media control buttons
- Functions mapped to colour buttons
- Alternate versions (Apple TV, Xbox Controller, etc.)

Note***
I have set this up using Home Assistant and my own image file created as an SVG for easy editing so you can cusotmise it as needed.
This will not work "out of the box" to control your devices or entertainment setup.
I have used a Logitech Harmony Remote and mapped all of the functions by creating each function as a template switch within Home Assistant.
This remote looks good and works well, but there will be a fair bit of setup in your own Home Assistant environment before you will be able to use this remote.
